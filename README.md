### What I learned

With this project, I learned to create the clone in an almost identical way. I used HTML (for the semantic structure) and CSS for the minimalist card styling.
After that I used the flexbox properties on CSS because in this way I made the style cleaner without actually having to use too many margins and padding.

<!-- Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge. -->

### Useful resources

- [Essential CSS Cheat Sheet](https://devchallenges.io/learn/2-responsive-web/css-essential-cheat-sheet#9.-Media-Queries) - From the official site that I completed the project, I reviewed the use of flexbox

<!--
- [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
